 Header of Left Menu view. It is used to provide some nice look to the Left Menu.
 The header is flexible and user can pull the bottom menu i.e table. The header
 adjusts itself on top and icon of the app remains in the middle. We will replace the icon
 of the application with User's profile picture in future when we will provide its support.
